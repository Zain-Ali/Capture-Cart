Web Scripting Coursework

You are to specify and construct HTML/CSS/JavaScript/AJAX web-pages and an API of PHP reponders that collectively support an easily-updated and customized “online shopping” capability for selling whatever kind of physical product your customer wishes.
That will imply that you need to build a “Content Management System” (CMS) that your client can use to describe and catalogue the products that they have for sale. It should be possible use the CMS (and needing nothing else) to add new products at any time, to delete products, to record that additional stock of a product has come in, and so on. The CMS enters those details into a database.

[In a finished website, those CMS pages would be subject to access controls, so that only your client's staff can access the CMS. You should not bother with such controls, though making them easy to add may influence parts of your design. In particular, you should not waste time on an unnecessary login system – worse, if such a login system goes wrong in marking the you have a serious problem.
